## [5.1.4] - 2021-05-10

### Fixed

- The CMake build system now generates pkgconfig files for the Fortran libraries

### Removed
- The GGA functionals LCGAU, LCGAU_CORE, and LC2GAU, since the implementation was not complete; the functionals have range-separation terms that cannot be described by the infrastructure in the version 5 series. The correct implementations are included in the version 6 branch

## [5.0.0] - 2020-04-06

### Added
- Framework to include worker functionals. These functionals are not intended to be use on their own, but as part of other functionals.

- Worker functionals: LDA_K_GDS08_WORKER.
- Correction to the Fermi_D term in MGGA_C_M05, MGGA_C_M05_2X, and MGGA_C_DLDF to avoid divergences when the kinetic energy density is zero, but not the density. This is similar to the correction proposed in from JCP 127, 214103 (2007). The correction is controlled by the `Fermi_D_cnst` external parameter, and its default value is 1e-10.
- Access to the internal parameters of several functionals. This is done using the same functions as for the external parameters.
- All functionals are now handled by Maple.
- Up to 4th-order for almost all functionals, and interface to access them.
- Printing of supported derivatives by the xc-info utility.
- New flag XC_FLAG_HAVE_ALL to indicate functionals that include all the currently available derivatives (exc, vxc, fxc, kxc, and lxc).
- Added the possibility of selectively disabling the compilation of vxc, fxc, kxc, and lxc to both Autotools and CMake build systems. By default kxc and lxc are not compiled. This allows for faster compilation times.
- Initial implementation of a GPU version of libxc

### Changed
- External parameters structure to include the name of the parameter. The name of the internal parameters is prepended with an underscore.
- Several functionals were modified to improve numerical stability. There are no more NaN or Infinities.
- Variable np is now size_t (8 bytes)
- Maple framework to generate the C code. In the new framework, the whole functional is handled by Maple, allowing the introduction of a unpolarized, ferromagnetic, and polarized case such that limiting cases are better handled.
- Integer type to c_int type in all Fortran 2003 interfaces.
- MGGA_C_TPSS to enforce z = tW/t <= 1 condition.
- XC_GGA_C_BCGP to XC_GGA_C_ACGGA, upon request by Antonio Cancio, keeping the old constant for backward compatibility.

### Fixed
- Missing terms in LDA_XC_KSDT and LDA_XC_GDSMFB.
- Incorrect parameter of GGA_C_GAPC.
- Incorrect definition of MGGA_C_KCIS.
- Incorrect definition of GGA_C_OPTC.

### Removed

## [4.3.4] - 2019-03-04

### Fixed
- Bug in XC_HYB_GGA_XC_CAM_QTP_01. Functional erroneously had 81% LYP and 19% VWN5, whereas it is supposed to have 80% LYP and 20% VWN5 correlation.

- Several missing functions and flags from the Fortran interfaces.
- Functions to get the list of available functionals (`xc_number_of_functionals`, `xc_maximum_name_length`, `xc_available_functional_numbers`, and `xc_available_functional_names`).

### Changed
- All functionals have been reimplemented using Maple to generate the corresponding C code.
- Updated default density thresholds for all functionals.
- Tests from the test suite are now separated by the derivative order (exc, vxc, and fxc). This allows to more easily identify the reason for failed tests and to set different tolerances for the different quantities.
- Split LDA_X into LDA_X and LDA_X_REL (see added functionals above). This replaces the external parameter that allowed to choose between the relativistic and non-relativistic versions of the functional.
- GGA_X_BGCP and GGA_C_BGCP to GGA_X_BCGP and GGA_C_BCGP, respectively, keeping the old constants for backward compatibility.
- MGGA_C_CC06 to MGGA_XC_CC06, as the functional includes an exchange part, keeping the old constant for backward compatibility.

### Removed
- Helper functionals that could be used in error instead of the true hybrid functional: MGGA_X_M05, MGGA_X_M05_2X, MGGA_X_M06_2X, MGGA_X_M06_HF, MGGA_X_M06, MGGA_X_M08_SO, MGGA_X_M08_HF, MGGA_X_M11.

### Changed
- GGA_XC_HCTH_A to GGA_C_HCTH_A, as it does not include exchange (it uses a different form for exchange than the other functionals from the HCTH family), keeping the old constant for backward compatibility.
- GGA_C_VPBE to GGA_C_regTPSS, as that is the name used in the paper, keeping the old constant for backward compatibility.

### Removed
* Helper functionals that can be used in error instead of the true hybrid functional: GGA_XC_B97, GGA_XC_B97_1, GGA_XC_B97_2, GGA_XC_B97_K, GGA_XC_B97_3, GGA_XC_SB98_1a, GGA_XC_SB98_1b, GGA_XC_SB98_1c, GGA_XC_SB98_2a, GGA_XC_SB98_2b, GGA_XC_SB98_2c, GGA_XC_WB97, GGA_XC_WB97X, GGA_XC_WB97X_V, GGA_C_WB97X_D, MGGA_X_MN12_SX.
