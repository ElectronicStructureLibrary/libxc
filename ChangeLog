	  src/xc_config.h: Patch by Janne.Blomqvist@tkk.fi:
	  
	  The attached patch does some minor optimizations and cleanups,
	  mostly
	  replacing usage of pow() with cbrt() as pow() can be somewhat
	  expensive.
	  
	  - Add tests for sqrtf, cbrtf, cbrt in configure.ac
	  - Add SQRT and CBRT macros to xc_config.h
	  - pow => POW if argument is FLOAT
	  - sqrt => SQRT if argument is FLOAT
	  - cbrt => CBRT
	  - POW(x, 1.0/3.0) => CBRT(x)
	  - POW(x, -1.0/3.0) => 1.0/CBRT(x)
	  - POW(x, 1.0/2.0) => SQRT(x)
	  - POX(x, -1.0/2.0) => 1.0/SQRT(x)
	  - POW(x, 1.0/4.0) => SQRT(SQRT(x))
	  - sqrt(2.0) => M_SQRT2
	  
	  Some of the pow(x,y) optimizations above can be done
	  automatically by
	  the compiler if one enables -ffast-math (or equivalent) but due
	  to
	  different corner-case behavior the compiler cannot enable them
	  otherwise (e.g. sqrt(-0.0) == -0.0 != pow(-0.0, 1.0/2.0) ==
	  +0.0). See
	  e.g.
	  
	  http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=25620
	  
	  http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=43419
	  
	  http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=42694
	  
	  http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=28252
	  
	  
	  I ran the testsuite, and while I did get some failures I also got
	  exactly the same failures with the trunk, so as far as the
	  testsuite
	  is concerned the patch does not affect the numerics in any way.

	  use this new infrastructure.
	  
	  To deal with dependencies I had to move the eigensolver
	  module from scf to system (as suggested by Miguel). This
	  is analogous to the linear solver in the case of OEP.
	  
	  Not all things are in place yet to use the functional

	* [r3667] src/gga_perdew.c: Bug correction from Jussi Enkovaara:
	  
	  I found a small bug in the PBE of libxc. In the function
	  "perdew_params"
	  in the file "gga_perdew.c" the total gradient "pt->gdmt"
	  
	  /* get gdmt = |nabla n| */
	  pt->gdmt = sigma[0];
	  if(pt->nspin == XC_POLARIZED) pt->gdmt += 2.0*sigma[1] +
	  sigma[2];
	  
	  can become a small negative number (in my antiferromagnetic
	  system ~ -1e-20), and
	  the following square root produces then NaN. I fixed that with a
	  simple if
	  statement i.e.
	  
	  /* get gdmt = |nabla n| */
	  pt->gdmt = sigma[0];
	  if(pt->nspin == XC_POLARIZED) pt->gdmt += 2.0*sigma[1] +
	  sigma[2];
	  if(pt->gdmt < 0.0) pt->gdmt = MIN_GRAD*MIN_GRAD;
	  pt->gdmt = sqrt(pt->gdmt);

2007-11-23 20:39  xavier

	* [r3597] configure.ac, m4/acx.m4, testsuite/xc-get_data.c: * Now
	  instead of using an integer of the size of a C pointer, there
	  exists an opaque c_pointer_t type that has two methods
	  associated,
	  set_null and is_null. This is the same we have already for libxc.
	  
	  * For the parser blocks there is a different type, block_t.
	  
	  * The only exception is xc_functl_write_info where a pointer is
	  used
	  both as a pointer and an integer. The variable is defined as
	  integer(SIZEOF_VOIDP), but we should fix it.
	  
	  * Removed the check for the non standard type 'long long' as a
	  candidate for equivalence fortran integer, in theory this could
	  be a
	  problem, but is very likely that if a fortran integer is 8 bytes
	  also
	  a 'long' is 8 bytes. A better solution would be to check first if
	  long
	  long or int64_t are available, and then use them.
	  
	  * Removed the check for the size of a pointer in C, instead the
	  size
	  of void * is measured using the standard macro.
	  
	  With this changes octopus compiles with gcc -pedantic-errors.

	  Incidentally, I found why my implementation of PW91 (correlation)
	  was
	  giving slightly different results than the reference
	  implementation in

	* [r2995] configure.ac, src/Makefile.am, src/libxc.f90: Moved the
	  fortran interface of libxc to the libxc/src/ directory. This
	  
	  Instead of the C_POINTER, I defined some derived types (with a
	  pointer
	  inside), so in theory they should have enough space to hold a
	  pointer
	  but I have to test it. This approach is also more elegant as the
	  types
	  can't be passed incorrectly and their contents are private, so
	  the
	  user can't modify them without libxc.

	* [r2771] Makefile.am, src/Makefile.am, testsuite/Makefile.am,
	  testsuite/xc-reference.pl, testsuite/xc-run_testsuite: This is a
	  boring maintenance commit concerning the automake build and
	  distribution system. It is likely that some of the nightly builds
	  will
	  fail or that someone encounters building problems. In that case,
	  just
	  bug me, I feel in charge to fix that.
	  
	  I wanted to get VPATH builds working, i. e. compiling in a
	  directory that
	  does not contain the source code. This makes it easily possible
	  to
	  configure and build a single source tree with lots of different
	  options
	  (avoiding tedious copying). VPATH is basically a GNU make feature
	  but
	  the Makfefile.ams have to follow certain restrictions to get it
	  working:
	  
	  1. Relative file names should be constructed with the $(srcdir),
	  $(top_srcdir), $(builddir), $(top_builddir) variables.
	  
	  2. Wildcards should not be used in automake variables. This means
	  that all source files have to be mentioned in the Makefile.am.
	  This
	  is a bit tiresome (especially in the PP directory) but it is
	  recommended in the GNU Coding Standard and considered good
	  practice.
	  So, please add any .inp and .test files you include in the
	  testsuite
	  to the corresponding Makefile.ams. This also holds for the .psf
	  files
	  (and the .hgh) if a new element should be discovered...
	  
	  3. I had to change the way the variable documentation is
	  generated a bit.
	  The main thing was to add command-line flags to specify input and
	  output
	  directories to the var2html.pl and mk_varinfo.pl scripts.
	  
	  4. Filename flags for the compilers (like -I) should not be added
	  to the
	  corresponding variable in the configure.ac but to the AM_ version
	  in
	  the approripate Makefile.am (or to its per target variant). This
	  makes use of $(srcdir), etc. possible. In some Makefile.ams the
	  compilation rule is redefined, in these cases, it has to be
	  checked if
	  the AM_ variant is included (e. g. src/Makefile.am).
	  
	  There were some more things I ran across:
	  
	  1. The testsuite can only be run after a make install because
	  the share data is not available otherwise. For that reason, I
	  replaced
	  the check target by an installcheck-local rule.
	  
	  2. The oct-run_testsuite script used hardcoded paths, they are
	  now
	  patched by the configure script. So, the oct-run_testuite is
	  replaced
	  by oct-run_testsuite.in and the original script will disappear in
	  my
	  next commit.
	  
	  3. The libxc testuite also needed some fixing to consider
	  different
	  source and build trees.
	  
	  4. I completely removed the AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS for the python
	  tree.
	  The conditional configuration of a subtree is a very subtle issue
	  as
	  automake does not support not configured subtrees. The
	  configure.ac and
	  Makefile.am of the python part seem to be in a very fragile
	  state, and as
	  it is not used anyway at the moment, I did not spend time to fix
	  them.
	  By the way, how is the state of the GUI? There is just few lines
	  of code
	  in the repository.
	  When it will be included again, I recommend just another
	  Makefile.am
	  and no subpackage configure. Necessary checks should be added to
	  our
	  main configure.ac (and can be skipped, if no GUI is requested).
	  
	  The code now passes the distcheck target which is desireable.

	* [r2590] testsuite/xc-get_data.c: Optimization:
	  
	  * Wrote a C version of dnl_operator_operate. The inner loop is
	  unrolled by hand to depth 3 and prefetching directives are used
	  to
	  keep the array of weights in the cache.
	  
	  For a test case (benzene gs with non interacting electrons, h=2.0
	  r=6.0), total performance was increased by a factor of 1.47 for
	  ifort
	  9.1 and by a factor of 2.2 for gfortran (p4 3.0GHz). In both
	  cases
	  gcc-4.1 was used.
	  
	  The new function is not enabled by default yet, but it is
	  selected by
	  the input variable OperateFunction, values can be either
	  'fortran' or
	  'c'.
	  
	  * Configure detects the presence of builtin functions
	  __builtin_expect
	  and __builtin_prefetch in the C compiler. If they are not found,
	  alternative dummy macros are provided.
	  
	  Fixed a couple of bugs revealed by gcc-2.95:
	  
	  * Assert is not always available in C. Put a check in
	  configure.ac.
	  * Move a declaration to the beginning of the function.

	  was not working, so the test was failing.
	  
	  The test testsuite/finite_systems_3d/11-sic.test seems a bit
	  weird to
	  me. The functional used is Slater's Xalpha with alpha=2/3, which
	  means
	  that it only uses exchange (it would be easier to put
	  Cfunctional=none
	  ;) Is this really the functional used in the reference (that I

	  *) Further cleanup of libxc. Now it was fxc that now has only 3
	  components (uu, ud, dd) for spin-polarized calculations. This
	  amounted
	  to changes in libxc and in octopus. Note that kxc is still not
	  changed.
	  It should include only the independent elements! Maybe Xavier
	  would like
	  to do it ;))
	  
	  *) Added a Perdew Wang modified lda functional. This is the
	  functional
	  used by Kieron in his implementation of the PBE (that i assume is
	  the
	  reference), and that is different from the published functional
	  (different number of digits in some costants, and he even has
	  incompatible definitions for the same constants). In this way,
	  the PBE
	  now gives the same as the reference numbers, so I rehabilitated
	  the
	  test. The differences to the previous implementation are very
	  small (4th
	  or 5th digit, but anyway...)
	  
	  *) Now we can have all-electron species also in 1 and 2
	  dimensions.

	  this commit:
	  
	  *) I finally understood the problem that Alberto was having. The
	  variable i in xc_functl_write_info was used for two things. In
	  the first
	  it should be a normal integer, and in the second it should be a
	  pointer.
	  That is why the code was crashing. I simply solved the problem by
	  using
	  two variables with different names.
	  
	  *) Added a macro called C_POINTER that has the obvious meaning of
	  integer(POINTER_SIZE). I also changed all occurences in the code
	  of
	  integer(POINTER_SIZE) to C_POINTER. I believe it is much more
	  readable
	  like that.
	  
	  *) Added two new functionals, Perdew Wang 86 and the exchange
	  part of
	  Perdew Wang 91. I think the introduction of new functionals will
	  slow
	  down now ;)

	* [r2468] configure.ac, src/functionals.c, src/xc.h, src/xc_f.c,

	  type that corresponds to the
	  Fortran type "integer". xc_f.c was the changed to use this macro.
	  This
	  should, hopefully, solve our previous problems. Now libxc has all
	  arguments "pure" Fortran integers.
	  
	  I tested this changes in i386 (ifc7.1), x64 (pathscale, nag, and
	  gfortran), and it passed all tests (with the exception of the
	  hyperpolarizability test that failed in ifc7.1 and *pathscale*,
	  but
	  Xavier alerady knows about it).
	  
	  *) Bug fix in xc-get_data.c. A missing "#include <stdlib.h>" was
	  making
	  the xc tests fail sometimes.

	  analitic functional and compares the difference. By now, three
	  functionals give problems PBE (exchange) has some NAN lingering
	  around;
	  PBE (correlation) and G96 have large deviations from the fd
	  results.
	  
	  *) Added a "provides" line to func_type. This is, e.g.,

	  calculate something using finite differences.

	  some LDA functionals. The calculated value of these functionals
	  is
	  compared to reference data that can be found in
	  http://www.cse.clrc.ac.uk/qcg/dft/.
	  
	  Note that the tests do give some errors. This is related to fully
	  polarized cases, i.e., when rho_down=0. The reference data
	  hard-wires,
	  in this case, the value of vpot_down=0, which, in my opinion, is
	  not
	  correct. In any case, if the gas is fully polarized, the value of
	  vpot_down is irrelevant in this case ;)
	  
	  There were some very small precision issues in a couple of
	  functionals
	  that I adjusted in order to match the reference data.
	  
	  In the process I added two new LDA "functionals":
	  *) lda_c_pz_mod. This is the version of the Perdew Zunger
	  functional
	  modified by Alberto to match better the low and high rs regions
	  of the
	  parametrization. This is the old pz that we had in the code. The
	  original PZ functional is called lda_c_pz. Note that the default
	  is the
	  corrected functional.
	  *) lda_c_vwn_rpa. This is a parametrization of the RPA
	  correlation

	* [r2424] AUTHORS, COPYING, ChangeLog, INSTALL, Makefile.am, NEWS,
	  README, configure.ac, m4, m4/acx.m4: First step in Making libxc
	  independent. Now it contains its own
	  configuration script. There are, however, several things still to
	  clean.

2006-06-18 11:32  athimm

	* [r2221] .: Exclude build-aux from entering svn.

2006-06-01 09:06  xavier

	* [r2174] lca.c: Portability fix, variable declaration was not in
	  the beginning of file.

2006-05-24 10:16  athimm

	* [r2149] Makefile.am: a) python and xml
	  - Make python conditional, on by default.
	  
	  Use --disable-python to turn off python (see ./configure --help)
	  
	  - Remove variables.xml generation from main code, make it
	  python-private. variables.xml are only used by the GUI. Let it
	  live
	  under share for now, we'll see were we'll put it in the future,
	  perhaps it will be removed altogether.
	  
	  b) Add some vpath fixes

2006-05-19 15:17  athimm

	* [r2117] .: Update svn:ignore recursively.

2006-05-14 10:52  athimm

	* [r2073] .: Ignore config.h stamp file.

2006-05-12 18:41  athimm

	* [r2063] ., .cvsignore: Sanitize .cvsignore and recursively feed
	  svn:ignore with them.
	  
	  The entries mirror the school of not committing generated files
	  into
	  the repository. Whether this is good or bad needs to be decided,
	  and
	  I'm probably in favour of adding them (as well as maintainer-mode
	  protection), but until this is agreed upon the current curse is
	  `minimal'.

2006-04-08 19:42  acastro

	* [r1992] gga_pbe.c, lda.c, test.c, xc_f.c: Some more profiling
	  tags, and some unimportant changes. For example, now
	  the wavefunctions are not randomly generated if then a LCAO
	  calculation
	  is going to be performed.

2006-04-05 13:52  acastro

	* [r1982] lda.c, lda_x.c, xc.h, xc_f.c: The option to interpolated
	  the LDA functionals instead of recalculating
	  them every time is now compiled always, although it is only used
	  if the InterpolateLDA is set to yes.
	  I will experiment with it for a few months to see if it is
	  worthed to
	  keep it as an option.

2006-04-04 19:59  acastro

	* [r1980] lda.c: Still one bug.

2006-04-04 19:42  acastro

	* [r1979] gga_lb.c, gga_pbe.c, lda_funcs.c, lda_x.c, mgga_x_tpss.c,
	  test.c, xc.h, xc_f.c: The XAlpha correlation functional was badly
	  calculated when code was
	  compiled with the "LDA_SPEEDUP" preprocessor flag. This option is
	  still
	  way too experimental to be compiled by default. If you want to
	  try it,
	  you have to define LDA_SPEEDUP (for example, setting
	  CPPFLAGS="-DLDA_SPEEDUP" when configuring).

2006-03-21 11:51  micael

	* [r1939] gga_lb.c, gga_pbe.c, lda.c, lda_funcs.c, lda_x.c,
	  mgga_x_tpss.c, util.h, xc.h, xc_f.c: *) Syncing the libxc in APE
	  with the one in Octopus.
	  This new version includes the relativistic correction to the LDA
	  exchange functional.
	  This is not really important for Octopus (at least for the time
	  being) but it is
	  necessary for APE.

2006-03-07 18:41  acastro

	* [r1881] lda_c_vwn.c: Bug fixed.
	  The Vosko/Wilk/Nusair xc potential had a bug related to units.
	  
	  Every time the initialization function was called, some
	  "constant" was
	  divided by two, in order to go from rydbergs to atomic units. But
	  the
	  inialization function is called twice by octopus, so the result
	  was
	  a factor of four.

2006-01-31 11:11  acastro

	* [r1797] gga_lb.c: Bug fixed.
	  Removed the 05-Na2_LB94_Casida bug.
	  The LB94 is still rather under suspiscion, in any case.
	  
	  I don't know why the bug was there, in fact, it looked that the
	  code
	  that I removed was there for a reason, but I could not trace it
	  down
	  because it was there since the first revision...

2005-11-28 11:03  marques

	* [r1726] lda.c, lda_c_vwn.c, lda_x.c, test.c: *) very tiny bug
	  corrected in VWN (one of the constants was wrong in the 5th
	  digit)
	  *) fxc is now calculated numerically a bit better in case of the
	  ferromagnetic gas. Actually I don't really know how to handle
	  this case properly, as fxc should diverge (at least fx).

2005-11-12 19:47  acastro

	* [r1650] lda_c_amgb.c: Bug fixed.
	  One wrong character kept me busy the whole afternoon.

2005-11-09 09:13  marques

	* [r1642] lda.c, xc.h, xc_f.c: *) Alberto, I think that the "break"
	  in the fxc calculation should be a
	  "continue" (i.e., he should skip the rest of the current cycle,
	  but
	  should get out of the cycle). Can you please check?
	  *) Xavier, I guess that the calculation of Kxc should have a
	  similar to
	  the one Alberto put in for fxc. Can you please check?
	  *) I cleaned a little bit the includes, whitespaces, and changed
	  "(*p)." to
	  "p->" as it is more C-like.

2005-11-08 22:01  acastro

	* [r1641] lda.c: Bug fixed.
	  
	  The numerical functional derivation was not working properly in
	  some
	  spin-polarized cases (Perdew-Zunger parameterization, Na4(+1), it
	  was
	  just giving lots of NaN). Now, at least for those cases, it seems
	  to
	  work. I still have to do some more testing on the Casida module,
	  though.
	  
	  In any case, the PZ kernel should be obtained analytically. Maybe
	  in the
	  future.

2005-10-18 12:51  xavier

	* [r1570] lda.c, util.h, xc.h, xc_f.c: Added Kxc, the third
	  derivatives of Exc, to libxc. It's calculated using a
	  second order numerical derivative of Vxc.

2005-10-12 13:43  marques

	* [r1554] lda_c_pw.c: There was a sign wrong in the definition of
	  pw92.
	  
	  Micael, can you please test this functional?

2005-10-12 09:10  marques

	* [r1552] Makefile.am: Some cleaning:
	  *) test.x is no longer generated in libxc/
	  *) changed the names of several single character variables.
	  Please *do not*
	  call a variable a, b, n, c or whatever!!!!
	  *) I noticed that some of you had tabs of 3 and 4 spaces. Do not
	  forget that
	  the default we agreed upon some years ago was *2*. Please change
	  you emacs
	  settings!

2005-09-05 16:36  acastro

	* [r1365] Makefile.am: It seems that the test_x_LINK variable needs
	  to be defined in this way
	  so that the executable is actually built.

2005-08-30 14:24  acastro

	* [r1346] Makefile.am: Since the test.x program is all C, it is
	  better to link with the C compiler.
	  Otherwise some Fortran compilers (i.e. the Intel 9.0 version)
	  seem to have
	  problems with a duplicated "main" function.

2005-07-11 13:23  acastro

	* [r1255] test.c: The xyzanim utility was broken, at least in the
	  IBM machines. I put
	  an emergency fix. If I get time I will take a look at the
	  utilities, see how
	  the system labels affect them, and make up some tests for them.
	  
	  Also, the IBM preprocessor had problems with the // comments in C
	  files..

2005-06-30 09:54  marques

	* [r1220] util.h: There were a couple of misspells in function
	  names

2005-06-07 11:58  acastro

	* [r1201] Makefile.am, xc_f.c: I forgot to change also this when I
	  changed the config.h stuff.

2005-05-17 09:55  appel

	* [r1121] Makefile.am: Add $Id:$ tags to most of the files (right
	  below the GPL header). At every
	  commit cvs is replacing these tags with lines of the following
	  form
	  
	  $Id: run_regression.pl,v 1.3 2005/05/12 10:23:59 marques Exp $
	  
	  In this way it is easy to see who was the last person changing
	  the file, which
	  cvs revision the file has and at what date the last change was
	  made.
	  
	  Miguel: Is there a reason why the *.c files in libxc/ don't have
	  a GPL header?

2005-04-06 16:33  marques

	* [r1081] lca_lch.c, lca_omc.c: LOL! Calculating derivatives is
	  always a hassle, even if only of simple functions ;))) Please
	  recheck them.

2005-04-06 14:45  micael

	* [r1079] Makefile.am, lca.c, lca_lch.c, lca_omc.c, util.h, xc.h,
	  xc_f.c: *) Added the Vignale-Rasolt functional for CDFT to libxc.
	  Two parametrizations
	  are available. This has *not* been tested carefully yet.

2005-04-04 12:57  acastro

	* [r1074] mgga_c_tpss.c: [*] A small change in the
	  "nl_operator_operate" subroutines, which,
	  specially in the complex case, seems to speed up things
	  significantly.
	  But most likely it does so only in some architecutures/compilers.
	  In the
	  case of the Portland compiler for opterons, the speedup is rather
	  spectacular, probably because before the type conversion was very
	  slow (the opteron was running slower that my laptop!)
	  [*] In mgga_c_tpss, some Portland C compilers complained about
	  those
	  array definitions, I think it is more correct now.

2005-03-28 10:47  acastro

	* [r1061] Makefile.am, lda.c, lda_x.c, xc.h, xc_f.c: A pretty sick
	  performance hack.
	  
	  The idea is the following: instead of calculating the LDA
	  functionals
	  everytime, one can "spline" them at the beginning, and then
	  interpolate
	  every time, since they are very smooth functions. Some comments:
	  
	  (*) The calculation of the LDA exchange and correlation
	  functionals do
	  not take a significant calculation time, *except* if one wants to
	  use the
	  SIC+LDA within the OEP/KLI approximation for a big molecule.
	  (*) This commit is still experimental, and in fact the code is
	  still
	  exactly the same as it was, if you do not compile adding the
	  LDA_SPEEDUP
	  preprocessor variable (by doing CFLAGS="-O3 -DLDA_SPEEDUP", for
	  example).
	  So you do not have to worry at all about this for the moment...
	  I will make sure that it works well and that it makes sense
	  before making
	  it definive.

2005-03-17 17:33  marques

	* [r1044] lda.c: Just a small rearrangement.

2005-03-17 17:23  marques

	* [r1043] gga_lb.c, gga_pbe.c, lda.c, lda_c_pw.c, lda_funcs.c,
	  lda_x.c, mgga_x_tpss.c, test.c, util.h, xc.h, xc_f.c: *) Removed
	  "relativistic exchange", as, I am not mistaken, the potential was
	  wrong.
	  *) Added support for LDA fxc. For now, fxc for exchange and
	  Perdew Wang
	  correlation are analytical, while the rest is calculated through
	  finite
	  differences. Honestly, from the tests I've made, I am inclined to
	  believe
	  that it is actually better to get the numerical derivative.
	  (However, I
	  would not throw away the work of a full day, would I ;)

2005-02-22 12:03  acastro

	* [r1014] lda_funcs.c: Bug fixed.
	  A small bug in the definition of the Slater Xalpha potential.
	  (Before it just added again the excahnge fucntional)
	  
	  Also, I have changed the definition of the alpha constant, to
	  meet the
	  usual definition in the literature:
	  
	  E_{xc}^{Xalpha} = (3/2)*alpha*E_x^{LDA}
	  
	  which means that the Xalpha correlation potential should be
	  defined as:
	  
	  E_{c}^{Xalpha} = ( (3/2)*alpha - 1)*E_x^{LDA}
	  
	  I have set the default to alpha = 1. In any case, the logical
	  thing would
	  be to define this functional as a exchange functional, rather
	  than as a
	  correlation part to be added to the exchange. But it is not
	  worthed to
	  loose too much time with this functional anyway...

2005-02-15 13:51  acastro

	* [r1007] xc_f.c: I have put the embryo of what could be the
	  octopus developer's guide.
	  It just contains the description of one module, which is lib_xc,
	  the
	  interface to Miguel's C library that contains the LDA, GGA and
	  mGGA
	  functionals. And in fact it is not even complete.
	  
	  In the way, I have decided to simplify a little bit the interface
	  to the library, so that it is a little bit more user friendly.

2005-02-02 03:07  appel

2004-12-15 15:01  marques

	* [r964] mgga_c_tpss.c, mgga_x_tpss.c: A couple of bugs solved, but
	  I still get non-sense. This functiona is too
	  sensitive to numerical erors in the calculation of derivatives, I
	  think...

2004-12-07 20:40  marques

	  fixed in correlation PBE (yes, there was a serious bug there)
	  TPSS correlation is apparently working for spin-unpolarized
	  systems. I still
	  did not check the spin-polarized functionals (neither x nor c).

	* [r938] Makefile.am, mgga.c, mgga_c_tpss.c, mgga_x_tpss.c, test.c,

	  *) Added support for the libxc LDA functionals. Due to this

	  functionals. There are 13 LDA functionals implemented until now.
	  The unpolarized versions work I think. The polarized I have some
